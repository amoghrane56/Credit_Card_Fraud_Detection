# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression is a project that aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm that can be applied to detect fraudulent activities based on various transaction features.

Here are the steps involved in building a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Logistic Regression:

Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that contains information about credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, time, merchant information, and anonymized variables. The dataset should also include a label indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or not.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for training a logistic regression model. This step may involve handling missing values, scaling numeric features, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary feature engineering.

Data Split: Split the dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the logistic regression model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Training: Create an instance of the logistic regression model and fit it to the training data. During training, the model learns the relationships between the input features and the target variable (fraud or non-fraud).

Model Evaluation: Use the trained logistic regression model to make predictions on the testing set. Compare the predicted labels with the actual labels to assess the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Remember to handle class imbalance issues that are common in credit card fraud datasets. Techniques such as oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) or undersampling the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions) can be used to address this imbalance.
